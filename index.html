        <h1>The Perfect Trip</h1>
        
        <p>I would like to travel somewhere that can give me new food, and beautful oppurtunities to sightsee. Like Switzerland, for the sights, and Nigeria, for the rich culture, food, and oppourtunity to learn more about the diaspora I'm apart of.</p>

        <p>I want to see Art, especially art that's important to the people of a country. </p>

        <p>And eat heavy cultural food, like food that a country would eat for a big holiday!</p>
